# Contributing

I love pull requests. Here's a quick guide.

Fork, then clone the repo:

    git clone git@github.com:your-username/workout_uploader.git

Make your changes.

Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr].

[pr]: https://github.com/lildude/workout_uploader/compare/

At this point you're waiting on me. I like to at least comment on pull requests
within three business days (and, typically, one business day). I may suggest
some changes or improvements or alternatives.
